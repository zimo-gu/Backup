## Bug Repots

What your bug report should have:

- A quick summary of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be **specific**
  - If applicable, give sample code
- Expected outcome
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Update Documentation

If you make any changes to API's, make sure to update the coresponding documentation to reflect those changes.

## Coding Style

When making any sort of contribution you should make sure your code fits in with the rest of the codebase. In order to do this there are a few things we ask.

- Use 2 spaces instead of tabs
- Use prettier to format code
  - This command is already set up with `npm run pretty`
